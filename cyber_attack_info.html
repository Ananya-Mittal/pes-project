        <!-- Phishing Section -->
        <div class="attack-section">
          <h2>Phishing</h2>
          <p>Phishing is a cyberattack method where attackers impersonate legitimate organizations or individuals to deceive victims into revealing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or financial data. This is often carried out through email, phone calls, or text messages.The impacts of phishing can include identity theft, financial loss, data breaches, and the erosion of trust in affected organizations. Advanced forms, such as CEO fraud and clone phishing, target high-value individuals or replicate legitimate communications for maximum deception.</p>
          <h3>Potential Impacts:</h3>
          <ul class="impact-list">
            <li>Identity theft</li>
            <li>Financial loss</li>
            <li>Data breaches</li>
            <li>Loss of personal or corporate information</li>

        <!-- Malware Section -->
        <div class="attack-section">
          <h2>Malware</h2>
          <p>Malware is a type of software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. It includes viruses, worms, ransomware, and Trojans. Malware can infect devices through malicious downloads, websites, or email attachments.Malware spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails, or compromised devices. Its effects can range from data corruption and unauthorized access to widespread system failures. For instance, ransomware encrypts victims' data, demanding payment to restore access, which often leads to operational downtime, financial loss, and reputational damage.</p>
          <h3>Potential Impacts:</h3>
          <ul class="impact-list">
            <li>Data corruption or loss</li>
            <li>System slowdowns or crashes</li>
            <li>Unauthorized access to personal or corporate information</li>
            <li>Potential for further exploits (e.g., ransomware)</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- Ransomware Section -->
        <div class="attack-section">
          <h2>Ransomware</h2>
          <p>Ransomware is a malicious software that locks or encrypts a victim's files, demanding payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key or to regain access to the system. It can cause widespread disruption, especially in business environments.Notable ransomware attacks like WannaCry and Ryuk highlight the severe consequences of unprotected systems.</p>
          <h3>Potential Impacts:</h3>
          <ul class="impact-list">
            <li>Loss of critical data</li>
            <li>Operational downtime</li>
            <li>Financial costs due to ransom payments and system restoration</li>
            <li>Reputational damage</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
    
        <!-- DDoS Section -->
        <div class="attack-section">
          <h2>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)</h2>
          <p>A DDoS attack involves overwhelming a target server, network, or website with traffic to make it unavailable to users. It is typically carried out by botnets, which are networks of compromised devices. resulting from negligence or carelessness. Insider threats are challenging to detect and can lead to data breaches, theft of intellectual property, financial fraud, or operational disruptions.These attacks often rely on botnets—networks of compromised devices—to flood the target. DDoS attacks disrupt services, cause significant revenue losses, and damage brand reputation, especially for e-commerce and high-traffic platforms. Organizations facing these attacks must invest in robust security measures to mitigate their impact and ensure business continuity. </p>
          <h3>Potential Impacts:</h3>
          <ul class="impact-list">
            <li>Website or service downtime</li>
            <li>Loss of revenue during downtime</li>
            <li>Damage to brand reputation</li>
            <li>Increased costs for security measures</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- Insider Threats Section -->
        <div class="attack-section">
          <h2>Insider Threats</h2>
          <p>Insider threats are attacks that originate from within the organization, such as from disgruntled employees, contractors, or business partners. These individuals may exploit their access to systems for malicious purposes. These threats can be intentional, such as sabotage or theft, or unintentional, resulting from negligence or carelessness. Insider threats are challenging to detect and can lead to data breaches, theft of intellectual property, financial fraud, or operational disruptions. The damage caused by insider threats often extends beyond immediate financial losses to long-term reputational harm.</p>
